osmplotr v0.2.1
===============

* vignette 'making-maps' renamed 'basic-maps' and tidied
* vignette 'making-maps-with-data' renamed 'data-maps' and tidied
* 'plot_osm_basemap' renamed 'osm_basemap', and now uses
    'ggplot2::coord_equal()' to ensure maps are scaled to bounding boxes.
* 'print_osm_map' added to enable device proportions to be automatically scaled
    to bounding boxes.
* manual entries cleaned up to remove non-exported functions

osmplotr v0.2.0
===============

Major update with (almost) all plotting routines shifted from 'graphics::plot'
to 'ggplot2'. All previous parameters specifying graphics devices (such as
heights and widths) no longer apply.

Changes:

* vignette 'downloading-data' removed (incorporate in 'making-maps')
* vignette 'making-maps' extended
* vignette 'making-maps-with-data' added
* Extensive examples added to most functions
* 'click_map' removed
* 'connect_highways' renamed 'get_highway_cycle'
* 'highways2polygon' renamed 'connect_highways'
* 'extract_highway', 'extract_highways', 'order_lines' no longer exported
* 'extract_osm_objects' now just returns objects (instead of '$obj' and
    '$warn'), and dumps warnings direct to screen.
* 'add_osm_groups' now accepts lists of simple spatial points as groups
* Coordinate reference system properly attributed to all objects
* many tests added
* Change to 'ggplot2' has considerably changed structure of many functions. For
  details see function examples and vignettes


osmplotr v0.1-3
===============

Changes:

* added 'add_axes' to plot lat-lon axes
* added 'add_osm_surface' to spatially interpolate continuous surfaces from
user-defined data
* added 'add_colourbar' to plot a colourbar legend for 'add_osm_surface'
* renamed 'group_osm_objects' to 'add_osm_groups' 
* added 'adjust_colours' to allow colours to be lightened or darkened
* all usages of 'xylims' (vectors of four components) and 'get_xylims' changed
to 'bbox' (2-by-2 matrices) for consistency with sp and tmap
* reduce size of 'london' data (through smaller bbox), with corresponding
changes in vignettes
