`osmplotr` enables OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to be downloaded (using the
[overpass API](https://overpass-api.de)) and used to produce highly customisable
maps. This vignette demonstrates both data downloading and the creation of
simple maps. The subsequent vignette ('making-maps-with-data') demonstrates how
`osmplotr` enables user-defined data to be visualised using OSM data.  The maps
in this vignette represent a small portion of central London, U.K.

## <a name="1 intro"></a>1. Introduction

A map can be generated using the following simple steps:
```{r load, message=FALSE}
library (osmplotr)
library (maptools) # Needed for this vignette
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
setwd ('../..')
devtools::load_all ('osmplotr', export_all=FALSE)
setwd ('./osmplotr/vignettes')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Combining (dat_B, dat_BC) and (dat_H, dat_HP) requires removing the repeated
# objects
indx <- which (!london$dat_BR$id %in% london$dat_BNR$id)
dat_B <- maptools::spRbind (london$dat_BR [indx,], london$dat_BNR)
indx <- which (!london$dat_H$id %in% london$dat_HP$id)
dat_H <- maptools::spRbind (london$dat_H [indx,], london$dat_HP)
dat_T <- london$dat_T
```
1. Specify the bounding box for the desired region
```{r}
bbox <- get_bbox (c(-0.13,51.50,-0.11,51.52))
```
2. Download the desired data---in this case, all building perimeters.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat_B <- extract_osm_objects (key='building', bbox=bbox)
```
3. Initiate an `osm_basemap` with desired background (`bg`) colour
```{r map1}
map <- plot_osm_basemap (bbox=bbox, bg='gray20')
```
4. Add desired plotting objects in the desired colour.
```{r}
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_B, col='gray40')
```
5. Print the map
```{r, eval=FALSE}
print (map)
```
```{r map1-print, echo=FALSE}
mapwd <- 500
mapht <- mapwd * diff (bbox [2,]) / diff (bbox [1,])
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map_a1.png')
print (map)
graphics.off ()
```
![map1](map_a1.png)


Additional capabilities of `osmplotr` are described in the following sections,
beginning with downloading and extraction of data.

## <a name="2 downloading"></a>2. Downloading Data

The main function for downloading OSM data from the 
[overpass API](https://overpass-api.de) is `extract_osm_objects`. Data of a
particular type can be extracted by passing the appropriate OSM `key`, as in the
above example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
bbox <- get_bbox (c(-0.13,51.51,-0.11,51.52))
dat_B <- extract_osm_objects (key='building', bbox=bbox)
dat_H <- extract_osm_objects (key='highway', bbox=bbox)
```
These objects are of appropriate `Spatial` classes:
```{r}
class (dat_B); class (dat_H); class (dat_T)
```
The `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`, `SpatialLinesDataFrame`, and
`SpatialPointsDataFrame` of London buildings, highways, and trees respectively
contain 
```{r}
length (dat_B); length (dat_H); length (dat_T)
```
... 2,178 building polygons, 2,139 highway lines, and 1,310 trees.
`extract_osm_objects` also accepts `key-value` pairs which are passed to the
[overpass API](https://overpass-api.de) :
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat_T <- extract_osm_objects (key='natural', value='tree', bbox=bbox)
```

## <a name="2.1 negation"></a>2.1 Negation

Negation can be specified by pre-pending `!` to the `value` argument so that,
for example, all `natural` objects that are **not** trees can be extracted with
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat_NT <- extract_osm_objects (key='natural', value='!tree', bbox=bbox)
```
`london$dat_H` contains all non-primary highways, and was extracted with,
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat_H <- extract_osm_objects (key='highway', value='!primary', bbox=bbox)
```

## <a name="2.2 keyval-pairs"></a>2.2 Additional `key-value` pairs

Any number of `key-value` pairs may be passed to `extract_osm_objects`. For
example, a named building can be extracted with
```{r, eval=FALSE}
extra_pairs <- c ('name', 'Royal.Festival.Hall')
dat <- extract_osm_objects (key='building', extra_pairs=extra_pairs, 
                                       bbox=bbox)
```
This data is stored in `london$dat_RFH`. Note that periods or dots are used for
whitespace, and in fact symbolise (in `grep` terms) any character whatsoever.
The polygon of a building at a particular street address can be extracted with
```{r, eval=FALSE}
extra_pairs <- list (c ('addr:street', 'Stamford.St'),
                     c ('addr:housenumber', '150'))
dat <- extract_osm_objects (key='building', extra_pairs=extra_pairs, 
                                      bbox=bbox)
```
This data is stored as `london$dat_ST`.  Note that addresses generally require
combining both `addr:street` with `addr:housenumber`.

## <a name="2.3 rivers"></a>2.3 A note on rivers

OSM objects are extracted within `R` through using the `osmar` package which
does not currently handle the extraction of rivers in a failsafe way. Rivers are
generally defined by `(key,value)=('waterway','riverbank')`, with relations
returned as an OSM `multipolygon`. These `multipolygon` objects are, however,
**not** extracted by `osmar` when they extend beyond a requested `bbox`, and
there is no way to know in advance whether or not that may be the case. This
requests to download river polygons may not yield the desired results.  This
problem will be addressed in future releases of `osmplotr`.

## <a name="2.4 downloading2"></a>2.4 Downloading with `osm_structures` and `make_osm_map`

The functions `osm_structures` and `make_osm_map` aid both downloading multiple
OSM data types and plotting (with the latter described below).  `osm_structures`
returns a `data.frame` of OSM structure types, associated `key-value` pairs,
unique suffices which may be appended to data structures for storage purposes,
and suggested colours. Passing this list to `make_osm_map` will return a list of
the requested OSM data items, named through combining the `dat_prefix` specified
in `make_osm_map` and the suffices specified in `osm_structures`.

```{r}
osm_structures ()
```
Many structures are identified by keys only, in which cases the values are empty
strings.
```{r}
osm_structures()$value [1:4]
```
The last row of `osm_structures` exists only to define the background colour of
the map, as explained below (**3.2 Automating map production**).

The suffices include as many letters as are necessary to represent all unique
structure names.  `make_osm_map` returns a list of two components:

1. `osm_data` containing the data objects passed in the `osm_structures`
   argument. Any existing `osm_data` may also be submitted to `make_osm_map`, in
   which case any objects not present in the submitted data will be
   appended to the returned version. If `osm_data` is not submitted, all objects in
   `osm_structures` will be downloaded and returned.
2. `map` containing the `ggplot2` map objects with layers overlaid according to
   the sequence and colour schemes specified in `osm_structures`

The data specified in `osm_structures` can then be downloaded simply by calling:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat <- make_osm_map (structures=osm_structures (), bbox=bbox)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat1 <- list (dat_BU=NULL, dat_A=NULL, dat_W=NULL, dat_G=NULL,
              dat_N=NULL, dat_P=NULL, dat_H=NULL, dat_BO=NULL, dat_T=NULL)
dat <- list (osm_data=dat1, map=ggplot2::ggplot ())
```
```{r}
names (dat); sapply (dat, class); names (dat$osm_data)
```
Where `dat$osm_data` contains the requested data.  A list of desired structures
can also be passed to this function, for example,
```{r}
osm_structures (structures=c('building', 'highway'))
```
Passing this to `make_osm_map` will download only these two structures.
Finally, note that the example of,
```{r}
osm_structures (structures='grass')
```
demonstrates the conversion of `keys` to OSM-appropriate `key-value` pairs.

### <a name="2.4.1 london-data"></a>2.4.1 The `london` data of `osmplotr`

To illustrate the use of `osm_structures` to download data, this section
reproduces the code that was used to generate the `london` data object which
forms part of the `osmplotr` package.
```{r}
structures <- c ('highway', 'highway', 'building', 'building', 'building',
                 'amenity', 'park', 'natural', 'tree')   
structs <- osm_structures (structures=structures, col_scheme='dark')   
structs$value [1] <- '!primary'   
structs$value [2] <- 'primary'
structs$suffix [2] <- 'HP'
structs$value [3] <- '!residential'
structs$value [4] <- 'residential'
structs$value [5] <- 'commercial'
structs$suffix [3] <- 'BNR'
structs$suffix [4] <- 'BR'
structs$suffix [5] <- 'BC'
```
Note that suffices are generated automatically from structure names only, not
values, requiring the suffices for negated forms to be specified manually.  The
`london` data was then simply downloaded by calling `extract_osm_objects` on
each row of the `structs` data frame. The additional lines in the following code
rename each downloaded object according to the suffices given in
`structs$suffix`.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
london <- make_osm_map (structures=structs, bbox=bbox)
london <- london$osm_data
```
As shown above, the requested data are contained in the `$osm_data` list item.
The `map` item is examined below (see **3.1 Automating map production**).

## <a name="2.5 highways"></a>2.5 Downloading connected highways

The visualisation functions considered below enable particular regions of maps
to be highlighted. While it may often be desirable to highlight regions
according to a user's own data, `osmplotr` also enables regions to be defined by
providing a list of the names of encircling highways. The function which
achieves this is `connect_highways`, which returns a sequential list of
`SpatialPoints` from those segments of the named highways which connected
continuously and sequentially to form a single enclosed space. An example is,
```{r, echo=FALSE}
highways1 <- london$highways1
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
highways <- c ('Monmouth.St', 'Short.?s.Gardens', 'Endell.St', 'Long.Acre',
               'Upper.Saint.Martin')
highways1 <- connect_highways (highways=highways, bbox=bbox)
```
Note the use of the 'regex' character '?' which declares that the previous
character is optional. This matches both "Shorts Gardens" and "Short's Gardens",
both of which appear in OSM data.
```{r}
class (highways1); length (highways1); head (coordinates (highways1))
```
Other examples, which are also included in the provided `london` data, include:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
highways <- c ('Endell.St', 'High.Holborn', 'Drury.Lane', 'Long.Acre')
highways2 <- connect_highways (highways=highways, bbox=bbox)
highways <- c ('Drury.Lane', 'High.Holborn', 'Kingsway', 'Great.Queen.St')
highways3 <- connect_highways (highways=highways, bbox=bbox)
```

The extraction of bounding polygons from named highways is not failsafe, and may
generate various warning messages.  To understand the kinds of conditions under
which it may not work, it is useful to examine `connect_highways` in more
detail.

### <a name="2.5.1 highways-detail"></a>2.5.1 `connect_highways` in detail

`connect_highways` finds a sequence of line segments that circularly connect the
named highways. Cases where no circular connection is possible generate an error
message. The function which actually connects the given highways into a circular
sequence is `get_highway_cycle`, which,

> Takes a list of OpenStreetMap highways returned by `extract_highways`
> and sequentially connects closest nodes of adjacent highways until the set of
> highways connects to form a cycle.

`connect_highways` proceeds through the three stages of,

1. Adding intersection nodes to junctions of ways where these don't already
   exist

2. Filling a connectivity matrix between the listed highways and extracting the
   **longest** cycle connecting them all

3. Inserting extra connections between highways until the length of the longest
   cycle is equal to `length (highways)`.

However, even once the highways are connected, the individual components of each
highway may not necessarily connect in a continuous manner to complete the
cycle. The final task, completed within the `connect_highways` routine, is thus
ensuring that the components of each individual highway actually connect,
through sequentially connecting the closest pair of components until a shortest
path is possible between the two components which connect with other highways.

This procedure can not be guaranteed failsafe owing both to the inherently
unpredictable nature of OpenStreetMap, as well as to the unknown relationships
between named highways. To enable problematic cases to be examined and hopefully
resolved, `connect_highways` has a `plot` option:
```{r connect_highways, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# TODO: Set eval=FALSE before cran re-sub!!
bbox_big <- get_bbox (c(-0.15,51.5,-0.10,51.52))
highways <- c ('Kingsway', 'Holborn', 'Farringdon.St', 'Strand',
               'Fleet.St', 'Aldwych')
highway_list <- connect_highways (highways=highways, bbox=bbox_big, plot=TRUE)
```

The plot depicts each highway in a different colour, along with numbers at start
and end points of each segment. This plot reveals in this case that highway#6
('Aldwych') is actually nested within two components of highway#4 ('Strand').
`connect_highways` searches for the shortest path connecting all named highways,
and since 'Strand' connects to both highways#1 and #5, the shortest path
excludes #6. This exclusion of one of the named components generates the
warning message. 


## <a name="3 maps"></a>3. Producing maps

Maps will generally contain multiple kinds of OSM data, for example,
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat_B <- extract_osm_objects (key='building', bbox=bbox)
dat_H <- extract_osm_objects (key='highway', bbox=bbox)
dat_T <- extract_osm_objects (key='natural', value='tree', bbox=bbox)
```

As illustrated above, plotting maps requires first making a basemap with a
specified background colour. Portions of maps can also be plotted by creating a
`basemap` with a smaller bounding box.
```{r map2}
bbox_small <- get_bbox (c(-0.13,51.51,-0.11,51.52))
map <- plot_osm_basemap (bbox=bbox_small, bg='gray20')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_H, col='gray70')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_B, col='gray40')
```
The proportions of graphics devices should be scaled in proportion to the
bounding box (although this is of course not necessary).
```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=2, eval=FALSE}
dev.new (width=8, height=8 * diff (bbox2 [2,]) / diff (bbox2 [1,]))
# or png, pdf, or whatever device is used for printing
print (map)
```
```{r map2-print, echo=FALSE}
mapht <- mapwd * diff (bbox_small [2,]) / diff (bbox_small [1,])
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map_a2.png')
print (map)
graphics.off ()
```
![map2](map_a2.png)


Other graphical parameters can also be passed to `add_osm_objects`, such as
border colours or line widths and types. For example,
```{r map3, eval=FALSE}
map <- plot_osm_basemap (bbox=bbox_small, bg='gray20')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_B, col='gray40', border='orange', size=0.2)
print (map)
```
```{r map3-print, echo=FALSE}
map <- plot_osm_basemap (bbox=bbox_small, bg='gray20')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_B, col='gray40', border='orange', size=0.2)
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map_a3.png')
print (map)
graphics.off ()
```
![map3](map_a3.png)

The `size` argument is passed to the corresponding `ggplot2` routine for
plotting polygons, lines, or points, and respectively determines widths of lines
(for polygon outlines and for lines), and sizes of points.  The `col` argument
determines the fill colour of polygons, or the colour of lines or points.

```{r map4, eval=FALSE}
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_H, col='gray70', size=0.7)
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_T, col='green', size=2, shape=1)
print (map)
```
```{r map4-print, echo=FALSE}
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_H, col='gray70', size=0.7)
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_T, col='green', size=2, shape=1)
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map_a4.png')
print (map)
graphics.off ()
```
![map4](map_a4.png)

Note also that the `shape` parameter determines the point shape, for details of
which see `?ggplot2::shape`. Also note that plot order affects the final
outcome, because components are sequentially overlaid and thus the same map
components plotted in a different order will generally produce a different
result.

The `osmplotr` package is intended to produce high quality graphical output
written to particular graphic devices such as `png` or `jpeg` (see `?png` for a
list of possible devices). `ggplot` readily enables map objects to be printed to
the active device so that graphics files can be generated by, for example,
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map.png')
print (map)
graphics.off ()
```


## <a name="3.1 osm-structures"></a>3.1 Plotting different OSM Structures

The ability demonstrated above to use negation in `extract-osm-objects` allows
different kinds of the same object to be visually contrasted, for example
primary and non-primary highways:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat_HP <- extract_osm_objects (key='highway', value='primary', bbox=bbox)
dat_H <- extract_osm_objects (key='highway', value='!primary', bbox=bbox)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat_HP <- london$dat_HP
dat_H <- london$dat_H
```
```{r map5, eval=FALSE}
map <- plot_osm_basemap (bbox=bbox_small, bg='gray20')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_H, col='gray50')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_HP, col='gray80', size=2)
print (map)
```
```{r map5-print, echo=FALSE}
map <- plot_osm_basemap (bbox=bbox_small, bg='gray20')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_H, col='gray50')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_HP, col='gray80', size=2)
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map_a5.png')
print (map)
graphics.off ()
```
![map5](map_a5.png)

The additional `key-value` pairs demonstrated above (for Royal Festival Hall,
`dat_RFH` and 150 Stamford Street, `dat_ST`) also above allow for highly
customised maps.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat_RFH <- london$dat_RFH
dat_ST <- london$dat_ST
```
These objects can then be individually plotted with different colour schemes.
```{r map7, eval=FALSE}
bbox_small2 <- get_bbox (c (-0.118, 51.504, -0.110, 51.507))
map <- plot_osm_basemap (bbox=bbox_small2, bg='gray95')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_H, col='gray80')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_HP, col='gray60', size=2)
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_RFH, col='orange', border='red', size=2)
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_ST, col='skyblue', border='blue', size=2)
dev.new (width=8, height=8 * diff (bbox_small2 [2,]) / diff (bbox_small2 [1,]))
print (map)
```
```{r map7-print, echo=FALSE}
bbox_small2 <- get_bbox (c (-0.118, 51.504, -0.110, 51.507))
map <- plot_osm_basemap (bbox=bbox_small2, bg='gray95')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_H, col='gray80')
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_HP, col='gray60', size=2)
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_RFH, col='orange', border='red', size=2)
map <- add_osm_objects (map, dat_ST, col='skyblue', border='blue', size=2)
mapht <- mapwd * diff (bbox_small2 [2,]) / diff (bbox_small2 [1,])
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map_a7.png')
print (map)
graphics.off ()
```
![map7](map_a7.png)


## <a name="3.2 make-osm-map"></a>3.2. Automating map production

As indicated above (**2.4 Downloading with `osm_structures` and
`make_osm_map`**), the production of maps overlaying various type of OSM objects
is facilitated with `make_osm_map`.  The structure of a map is defined by
`osm_structures` as described above.

Producing a map with customised data is as simple as,
```{r map8, eval=FALSE}
structs <- c ('highway', 'building', 'park', 'grass', 'tree')   
structures <- osm_structures (structures=structs, col_scheme='light')   
dat <- make_osm_map (structures=structures, bbox=bbox)
map <- dat$map
dev.new (width=8, height=8 * diff (bbox [2,]) / diff (bbox [1,]))
print (map)
```
```{r map8-print, echo=FALSE}
structs <- c ('highway', 'building', 'amenity', 'park', 'grass', 'tree')   
structures <- osm_structures (structures=structs, col_scheme='light')   
osm_dat <- list (dat_B=dat_B, dat_H=dat_H, dat_P=london$dat_P,
                 dat_A=london$dat_A, dat_G=london$dat_G, dat_T=london$dat_T)
dat <- make_osm_map (structures=structures, osm_data=osm_dat)
map <- dat$map
mapht <- mapwd * diff (bbox [2,]) / diff (bbox [1,])
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map_a8.png')
print (map)
graphics.off ()
```
![map8](map_a8.png)

Because no bounding box was passed to `make_osm_map`, a bounding box is
extracted as the **largest** box spanning all objects in `osm_data`. These
objects include highways which extend beyond the defining bounding box, and the
large park in the south east.  Passing the previous bounding box to the same
call, and using the data downloaded from that call to avoid repeating the
download, gives:
```{r map9, eval=FALSE}
dat <- make_osm_map (osm_data=dat$osm_data, structures=structures,
                     bbox=bbox_small)
print (dat$map)
```
```{r map9-print, echo=FALSE}
dat <- make_osm_map (structures=structures, osm_data=osm_dat, bbox=bbox_small)
mapht <- mapwd * diff (bbox_small [2,]) / diff (bbox_small [1,])
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map_a9.png')
print (dat$map)
graphics.off ()
```
![map9](map_a9.png)

Objects in maps are overlaid on the plot according to the order of rows in
`osm_structures`, with the single exception that `background` is plotted first.
This order can be readily changed or restricted simply by submitting structures
in a desired order.

```{r}
structs <- c ('amenity', 'building', 'grass', 'highway', 'park')
osm_structures (structs, col_scheme='light')
```

As described above (**2.4 Downloading with `osm_structures` and
`make_osm_map`**), if existing `osm_data` are not passed to `make_osm_map`, then
all data will be downloading by that function and returned in the `$osm_data`
list component.

## <a name="3.3 axes"></a>3.3 Axes

Axes may be added to maps using the `add_axes` function. In contrast to many `R`
packages for producing maps, maps in `osmplotr` fill the entire plotting space,
and axes are added *internal* to this space. The separate function for adding
axes allows them to be overlaid on top of all previous layers.

Axes added to a dark version of the previous map look like this:
```{r map10}
structures <- osm_structures (structures=structs, col_scheme='dark')   
dat <- make_osm_map (structures=structures, osm_data=dat$osm_dat, bbox=bbox)
map <- add_axes (dat$map, colour='black')
```
Note that, as described above, `make_osm_map` returns a list of two items: (i)
potentially modified data (in `$osm_data`) and (ii) the map object (in `$map`).
All other `add_` functions take a map object as one argument and return the
single value of the modified map object.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
print (map)
```
```{r map10-print, echo=FALSE}
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map_a10.png')
print (map)
graphics.off ()
```
![map10](map_a10.png)

This map reveals that the axes and labels are printed above semi-transparent
background rectangles, with transparency controlled by the `alpha` parameter.
Axes are always plotted on the left and lower side, but positions can be
adjusted with the `pos` parameter which specifies the,
> Positions of axes and labels relative to entire plot device

```{r map11, eval=FALSE}
map <- add_axes (map, colour='blue', pos=c(0.1,0.2))
print (map)
```
```{r map11-print, echo=FALSE}
map <- add_axes (map, colour='blue', pos=c(0.1,0.2))
png (height=mapht, width=mapwd, file='map_a11.png')
print (map)
graphics.off ()
```
![map11](map_a11.png)

The second call to `add_axes` overlaid additional axes on a map that already had
axes from the previous call. The current version of `osmplotr` does not allow
text labels of axes to be rotated. (This is because the semi-transparent
underlays are generated with `ggplot2::geom_label` which currently prevents
rotation.)
